# Introduction to Voyant

Voyant Tools is an open-source text analysis tool available online. It was designed with the digital humanities in mind, with the goal of making reading and interpretation easier for its users. With plain text, HTML, XML, PDF, RTF, and MS Word files, Voyant can generate word clouds, display word frequency or collocation, and perform other text mining functions. Voyant Tools have been used by researchers to analyze texts in a variety of contexts, including literature, language teaching, healthcare, and system architecture.

## Single Document Analysis 

I am currently looking for a job and would like to create a resume and cover letter in such a way that it get shortlisted for the further interview process. Outstanding cover letters and resumes can turn a middle-of-the-road candidate into a top contender. It is vital to create a resume and cover letter in a manner that it is selected by recruiters. Recruiter uses sourcing tools to shortlist resumes and cover letters for the interview process. Sourcing tools aim to shortlist candidates through smarter job matching. The goal is to create a pool of quality candidates who have skill sets that are as close as possible to the job description criteria.

I will use Voyant to analyze job posting text to draw upon the important words/text and utilize those to craft my resume and cover letter. Please download the job posting description for this module by clicking [HERE](https://github.com/DagaGargi/Step-by-Step-guide-to-Voyant/raw/master/Job%20Posting.docx)

## Getting Started

* Start by opening [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/) in your web browser. There are two ways to open a corpus or text for analysis. The first is to choose open. This will give you the option to work with one of the pre-loaded corpuses in Voyant - the complete works of William Shakespeare, and the complete works of Jane Austen. These are good resources if you’re curious to see what you can do in Voyant, or if you happen to be working on research about either of these corpuses.

* Select upload to upload your own text or corpus. Choose the job posting description file from your computer that we downloaded in the previous section to analyze from this point. Voyant understands plain text, HTML, XML, PDF, RTF, and MS Word.

* Once you’ve uploaded the file, you’ll see your Voyant “dashboard”.
